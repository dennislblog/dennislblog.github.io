      <description>&lt;p&gt;To better understand market player&amp;rsquo;s equilibrium responses in a perfect competitive marketplace, we take our look at how the imperfect competition among finite many market makers drives the dynamics of price discovery. In this post, I will review two papers: one that investigates price competition among $M$ market makers (Bondarenko, 2001) and another where $M$ liquidity providers submit their demand price schedule (i.e., quantities) based on a common clearing price (Nishide, 2006). Through reviewing these works, I hope to gain insight on how imperfect competition among market makers (or liquidity providers) affects the price formation and price discovery during the trading periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although market microstructure models have been proposed for over thirty years, only a few studies on how market makers and informed traders interact to form a competitive price (Cho, 2004). In this blog, I will review several market microstructure models with detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
