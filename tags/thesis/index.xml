      <title>Review of Competing Market Makers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To better understand market player&amp;rsquo;s equilibrium responses in a perfect competitive marketplace, we take our look at how the imperfect competition among finite many market makers drives the dynamics of price discovery. In this post, I will review two papers: one that investigates price competition among $M$ market makers (Bondarenko, 2001) and another where $M$ liquidity providers submit their demand price schedule (i.e., quantities) based on a common clearing price (Nishide, 2006). Through reviewing these works, I hope to gain insight on how imperfect competition among market makers (or liquidity providers) affects the price formation and price discovery during the trading periods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although market microstructure models have been proposed for over thirty years, only a few studies on how market makers and informed traders interact to form a competitive price (Cho, 2004). In this blog, I will review several market microstructure models with detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post, I will review most cited approaches in the field of inverse reinforcement learning (and imitation learning) that are pertain to my dissertation. We have two main interests:
 To explain agent&amp;rsquo;s behavior through describing its reward structure and explore the relationship between the informed trading intensities and the reward function (e.g., when informed trading is more likely to occur, the magnitude of price change might be less important than the order imbalance).</description>
